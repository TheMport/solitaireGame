Project 1 
--  Used ChatGPT tp debug errors in syntax 
--  Credits for usage of sprites in "sprites" folder 
--  Worked in section in order to get grabber function to work properly 
--  Used ChatGPT to help get my deck opperation working better

Project 2 Adjustments 
--  Used chatGPT to debug errors in syntax when needed
--  Created "undo" button in main
--  Adjusted grabber to work properly with stacks not working properly
--  Added a refresh on the deck
--  Game Winner screen located in main



-- Postmortem --

--  Cards disappearing was due to incorrect card insertion logic
--  This was adjusted in grabber.lua and had to adjust wasteCard error

--  Disappearing cards from the deck was adjusted with a simple 
--  fix to arrangeWastePile

--  I was unable to create a working click to add to the correct possible pile

--  A lot of my code from project one needed adjustment in order to ensure a better solitaire experience for the user

--  Utilized tables for stacks

-- Code is refactored and working as a solitaire game would
